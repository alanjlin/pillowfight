# Pillowfight
cs3110 spring 2018 final project - pillowfight game
## External Dependencies
As this is a project written in OCaml, we require opam to run our project. Instructions here: https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html
Specifically, we use opam version 1.2.2, but it should work all the same in future iterations.
We also use the Js_of_ocaml compiler to run our OCaml programs in JavaScript. Installation is easy with opam.
